#' Reduced chi-square test or mean square weighted deviation (mswd) test
#' 
#' @param age A vector of age radiometric age estimates
#'
#' @param sd A vector of the standard deviation corresponding to each element in \code{age}
#' 
#' @return A numeric vector of length one with the p-value corresponding to the test.

#' @details From Ludwig (2003:646): "By convention,  probabilities  of  fit  greater  than  0.05  are  generally
#' considered  as  arguably  satisfying  the  mathematical  assumptions  of  an  isochron,  while  lower
#' probabilities are generally taken as indicating the presence of “geological” scatter, and hence a significant
#' possibility of bias in the isochron age."
#' The term  mswd*d.f. is used because the term 1/d.f. was involved in the calculation of mswd, and we need the chi-sq
#' The null hypothesis is that the isochron conditions hold
#' 
#' @examples
#' data(laventa)
#' # Do the age estimates for the Neiva Fm. conform to the isochron hypothesis?
#' oneLevelIndex <- which(laventa$unit == "Neiva Fm.") 
#' mswd.test(age = laventa$age[oneLevelIndex], sd = laventa$one_sigma[oneLevelIndex])
#' # The p-value is smaller than the nominal alpha of 0.05, so we can reject the null hypothesis of isochron conditions
#'
#' # Do the age estimates for the samples JG-R 88-2 and JG-R 89-2 conform to the isochron hypothesis?
#' twoLevelsIndex <- which(laventa$sample == "JG-R 89-2" | laventa$sample == "JG-R 88-2")
#' dataset <- laventa[twoLevelsIndex, ]
#' remove the values 21 and 23 because of their abnormally large standard deviations
#' mswd.test(age = dataset$age[c(-21, -23)], sd = dataset$one_sigma[c(-21, -23)])
#' # The p-value is larger than the nominal alpha of 0.05, so we can not reject the null hypothesis of isochron conditions
