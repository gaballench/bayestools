\title{Reduced chi-square test or mean square weighted deviation (mswd) test}
\usage{
mswd.test(age, sd)
}
\arguments{
\item{age}{A vector of age radiometric age estimates}

\item{sd}{A vector of the standard deviation corresponding to each element in \code{age}}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length one with the p-value corresponding to the test.
}
\description{
Reduced chi-square test or mean square weighted deviation (mswd) test
}
\details{
From Ludwig (2003:646): "By convention,  probabilities  of  fit  greater  than  0.05  are  generally
considered  as  arguably  satisfying  the  mathematical  assumptions  of  an  isochron,  while  lower
probabilities are generally taken as indicating the presence of “geological” scatter, and hence a significant
possibility of bias in the isochron age."
The term  mswd*d.f. is used because the term 1/d.f. was involved in the calculation of mswd, and we need the chi-sq
The null hypothesis is that the isochron conditions hold

\examples{
data(laventa)
# Do the age estimates for the Neiva Fm. conform to the isochron hypothesis?
oneLevelIndex <- which(laventa$unit == "Neiva Fm.") 
mswd.test(age = laventa$age[oneLevelIndex], sd = laventa$one_sigma[oneLevelIndex])
# The p-value is smaller than the nominal alpha of 0.05, so we can reject the null hypothesis of isochron conditions

# Do the age estimates for the samples JG-R 88-2 and JG-R 89-2 conform to the isochron hypothesis?
twoLevelsIndex <- which(laventa$sample == "JG-R 89-2" | laventa$sample == "JG-R 88-2")
dataset <- laventa[twoLevelsIndex, ]
remove the values 21 and 23 because of their abnormally large standard deviations
mswd.test(age = dataset$age[c(-21, -23)], sd = dataset$one_sigma[c(-21, -23)])
# The p-value is larger than the nominal alpha of 0.05, so we can not reject the null hypothesis of isochron conditions
